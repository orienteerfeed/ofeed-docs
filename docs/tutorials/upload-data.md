# Upload Data

You can use either the manual method or the API for uploading. The manual method is more suitable for the initial upload, while the API can automatically handle uploads during the event.

## Manual

In the event `Settings` (you need to be logged in), you can drag and drop XML files containing the start list or results.

## Automatic

Check the list of available [integrations](/category/integrations) that enables direct upload to the platform.
