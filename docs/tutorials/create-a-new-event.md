# Create a New Event

The first step is to create a new event that will store all your data. You need to be logged in, and then you can create a new event by clicking the `+ Create event` button.

and filling out the form.

:::tip
The switch on the `Visibility` card keeps your event private and accessible only via a direct link. Useful for testing.
:::

## Generate event password

The password is used to update event details. The **event ID** is also **required** to set up the connection in, for example, `OChecklist` or the `QuickEvent service`.

:::info
The password is valid for 7 days. Keep an eye on the countdown and regenerate the password if needed.
:::

:::warning
When you delete all event data, the password is deleted as well. Don’t forget to inform the start crew that both the original password and a new QR code (with a new password) have been regenerated. Provide them with a new one.
