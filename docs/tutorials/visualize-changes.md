# Visualize Changes

The table report with filters enables checking and tracking changes in real-time. Can be used for manual processing into organising software.

Click on the `Report` button to display a table with changes
![Report open](/img/tutorials/client/report_open.png)

Filter the records as you need. Check the `Origin` column describing the data's origin. You can use **predefined** filters that can be combined:

- `Card changes`
- `Note changes`
- `Late starts`
- `Did not start`

or simply type or select the value you are looking for in the column header. Data are **automatically** refreshed every **30s**.

Use the **checkbox** in the first column to mark **processed** changes (in case you process it manually) which are then coloured <span class="green-qe-service-dot">green</span>. You can export `CSV` or `PDF` with filtered changes if needed.
