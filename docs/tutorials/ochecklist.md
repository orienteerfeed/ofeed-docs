## How to Connect

1. Create a new account at https://orienteerfeed.com/signup
2. Create a new event and generate a new password
3. Upload data (either manually upload an IOF XML file or use a dedicated service based on your organizing software)
4. Connect the device running the OChecklist app to the internet
5. Scan the QR code within the OChecklist mobile app—both outside and inside scanning options work.
   - You can easily share the QR code with the start crew by clicking the `Share` button and selecting your preferred communication app (Messenger, WhatsApp, etc.)

## Changes Synchronisation

- Changes made at the start are uploaded to the `OFeed` platform at regular intervals
- Changes made at the registration office, via online forms, etc., are detected and downloaded to the OChecklist app. You are synchronized with the `OFeed` database in real time

If a synchronization error occurs, the `OFeed` icon will have a red background.

![Error status](/img/tutorials/ochecklist/ochecklist_09_ofeed_error_status_50proc.jpg)

Under normal conditions (when everything works as expected), it should be green

![OK status](/img/tutorials/ochecklist/ochecklist_10_ofeed_ok_status_50proc.jpg)

You can open the log by clicking the `OFeed` icon in the upper right corner.
