## How to reach us?

You can choose from several ways to contact the OFeed team or the community around the platform. We prefer `Discord` and `GitHub`, where the rest of the community can respond as well.

### Github

Create a new [issue](https://github.com/orienteerfeed/ofeed/issues) with a description, or even better, submit a pull request and we will review it.

### Discord

Our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QMvnurgKzU) has a dedicated `help` channel where you can create a new post with a detailed description. Add any related files or images if possible. The OFeed team or other community members can help you resolve the issue.
