`OFeed` is fully integrated into the `OChecklist` mobile app and can be used as a [data source](/tutorials/connect-ochecklist). Data is loaded at the start and updated regularly as you make changes in your organizing software. The start crew has access to up-to-date information throughout the event, and any changes at the start are transferred back to the OFeed platform for further processing.
