# How to reach us?

You can choose from several ways to contact the OFeed team or the community around the platform. We prefer `Discord` and `GitHub`, where the rest of the community can respond as well.

## Github

Create a new [issue](https://github.com/orienteerfeed/ofeed/issues) with a description, or even better, submit a pull request and we will review it.

## Discord

Our Discord server ([invite](https://discord.gg/QMvnurgKzU)) has a dedicated `help` channel where you can create a new post with a detailed description. Add any related files or images if possible. The OFeed team or other community members can help you resolve the issue.

## Email

Send an email to <a href="mailto:support@orienteerfeed.com">support@orienteerfeed.com</a> for support.

# Support us

The platform is free and always will be. We only need to cover the web hosting costs required to run the service. If the service has saved you time or improved your event, you can support us by buying us a coffee [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/ofeed). We would be very grateful for any amount. Thanks :heart:.

# FAQ

Everything is clear so far :grin:.
