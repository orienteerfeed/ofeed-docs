# Contribute

`OFeed` is open source software. As such, we welcome contributions and help from any and all interested people.

## Providing Feedback

We don't know of a better way to test than by using it during events. It doesn't matter if it's training or a race. Every use on real data is the best way to verify functionality. It also provides a lot of feedback, which we are very interested in. We would be very happy if you would write your findings on Discord or create an issue on Github.

## Writing/Editing Documentation

If you find any inaccuracies or something in the documentation is unclear, we would appreciate your feedback. You can use the button at the bottom of the page to open the relevant file.

## Translating

Both `OFeed` and `OFeed Docs` can be translated into your language. The already supported languages are shown in the language dropdown menu. We would be delighted to have `OFeed` translated into additional languages.

### OFeed

We are using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/ofeed/), thanks to Michal Čihař.

Available components for translation:

- `Client-common` — general strings
- `Client-translation` — app-specific strings
- `SI-Droid Connector` — mobile app strings

When you login in with GitHub account to Weblate when translation you will be automatically listed as a contributor.

### OFeed Docs

The best way to translate the documentation is to follow the official Docusaurus [guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/tutorial) and then create a pull request.

### Questions

If you want to contribute and you're not sure how, take a look at the page on how to [support](/support) and send us a message. We’ll be happy to answer any questions.

## Cash Donations

The platform is free and always will be. We only need to cover the web hosting costs required to run the service. If the service has saved you time or improved your event, you can support us by buying us a coffee [👉](https://buymeacoffee.com/ofeed). We would be very grateful for any amount. Thanks :heart:.
