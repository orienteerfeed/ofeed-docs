# Translations

Both `OFeed Web` and `OFeed Docs` can be translated into your language. The supported languages are shown in the language dropdown menu. We would be delighted to have OFeed translated into additional languages.

## OFeed web

There are two translation files at the moment:

- `common.json` — general strings

- `translation.json` — app-specific strings

Files for already translated languages are available at `/apps/client/src/i18n/locales`.

## OFeed docs

The best way to translate the documentation is to follow the official Docusaurus [guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/tutorial) and then create a pull request.
